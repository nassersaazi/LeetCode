In Python, a while loop may have an optional else block. Here, the else part is executed after the condition of the loop evaluates to False . Note: The else block will not execute if the while loop is terminated by a break statement.

  newList = [ expression(element) for element in oldList if condition ]

Pros of list comprehension
- More time-efficient and space-efficient than loops
- Require fewer lines of code
- Transform iterative statement into formula
